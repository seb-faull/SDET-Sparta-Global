Feature: cucumber expressions
  As a user I want to see how cucumber scenarios work

  Scenario: I am able to utilise integers
    Given I provide an integer of 3
    Then I will have 3 types of this veg in my belly:
      |   veg    |   num  |
      | cucumber |    1   |
      | beetroot |    2   |
      | carrrot  |    3   |

  # Scenario: I am able to utilise floats and carrots
  #   Given I provide an floats of 4.5 and carrot
  #   Then I will have 4.5 carrot in my belly
  #
  #   @beetroot
  # Scenario: I am able to utilise floats and beetroot
  #   Given I provide an floats of 4.5 and beetroot
  #   Then I will have 4.5 beetroot in my belly
